<h2>Version control</h2>
<p>Kyou automatically saves all changes. However, sometimes you might need to revert some changes to an older point in time.</p>

<p>The version control system does this by allowing you to save a page's state and allows you to return to any previously saved state.</p>

<h3>Create revision</h3>
<p>The create revision menu is use to save page's current state. You also can optionally enter a description.</p>

<h3>Run version control</h3>
<img src="/help/img/ushio.png" class="thumbnail">
<p>After clicking "Run version control", you will be taken to a new page. In this page the latest saved state is shown. The description and the time that this revision was saved is shown in the box below</p>
<p>Note that the preview content can be scrolled and copied from.</p>
<ul class="unstyled">

	<li><i class="icon-ok"></i> Return to this revision</li>
	<li><i class="icon-home"></i> Return to editor</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Warning:</strong> Returning to a revision cannot be undone. Save revision first if you need to return to the current revision in the future.</div>
